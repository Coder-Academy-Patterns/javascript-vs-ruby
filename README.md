# javascript-vs-ruby

A comparison between Ruby and JavaScript is presented for a range of problems and data types. Flick between the .rb and .js to compare what is similar and what is different between the two languages.

You can run the Ruby ones using `ruby 1.rb`.
You can run the JavaScript ones using `node 1.js`.

## Challenges

1. Look at the .rb file, and write a new .copy.js from scratch. Use the given .js file as a reference
